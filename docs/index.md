Dirtbags Tanks is a game in which you pit your coding abilities
against other hackers.  You write a program for your tank, set it out
on the battlefield, and watch how your program fares against tanks
written by other players.  Dirtbags Tanks is frequently a component of
[Dirtbags Capture The Flag](/ctf/).

Each tank has a turret-mounted laser, two treads, up to ten sensors,
and a diagnostic LED.  Sensors are used to detect when other tanks are
inside a given arc.  In the examples on this page, "triggered" sensors
turn black.  Most tanks will take some action if a sensor is
triggered, such as changing speed of the treads, turning the turret,
or firing.

Tanks are programmed in Forf, a stack-based language similar to
PostScript.
